Agent-based construction seeks to emulate these advantages, but the two common approaches - swarm robotics and fully virtual agent simulations - are held back by limitations that are difficult to overcome in isolation. Here we demonstrate initial steps towards the application of biological design principles, particularly the so-called Bernard Machine. 3D printing is used to materialize the actions of virtual agents in a physical environment. Such an arena requires a shift from monolithic printing processes to interactive ones: assemblage printing. We demonstrate an alternative to conventional slicer-controlled printing that is discrete and to an extent nonsequential and which forms the foundation for assemblage printing. In its extension it allows for the exploration of a fully agent-based construction process.","accessed":null,"author":[{"given":"David","family":"Andréen"},{"given":"Ana","family":"Goidea"},{"given":"Anton","family":"Johansson"},{"given":"Erik","family":"Hildorsson"}],"citation_key":"andreenSwarmMaterializationDiscrete2019","container_title":"2019 IEEE 4th International Workshops on Foundations and Applications of Self* Systems (FAS*W)","DOI":"10.1109/FAS-W.2019.00059","event_place":null,"event_title":"2019 IEEE 4th International Workshops on Foundations and Applications of Self* Systems (FAS*W)","issued":{"year":2019,"month":6,"day":null},"language":null,"license":"All rights reserved","page":"225-230","publisher":null,"publisher_place":null,"source":"IEEE Xplore","title":"Swarm Materialization Through Discrete, Nonsequential Additive Fabrication","type":"paper-conference","URL":null}]}]}},"pageContext":{}},"staticQueryHashes":["2398550977"],"slicesMap":{}}
