projects:
  - name: Meristem Wall
    type: binder-jet sand 3D-printed prototype for building envelope
    description: >-
      Meristem Wall is a prototype of a fully 3d printed building envelope. It
      is made using sand binder jetting by Voxeljet and Sandhelden, complemented
      by a custom CNC knitted fabric developed and fabricated in collaboration
      with Dr. Mariana Popescu of Block Research Group at ETH Zürich.


      The wall is designed using an interdependent model that negotiates the
      space and relationship between a wide range of functions including
      utilities such as electric wiring, aesthetic preferences, structural
      performance, and bioclimatic considerations. This self-organising
      simulation is capable of creating unique compositions of space to fit a
      wide range of context and functional needs.

      A circular undulating clay wall 5 m high with a 6 m radius built using a

      project Adaptive Clay Formations. The project was preceded by the
      construction of a full scale prototype of a quarter of final design in
      Brunnen, Switzerland. The wall is built to surround a acoustic lab built
      in a new co-working space in the Gurtenbrauerei in Bern.

      MAS DFAB thesis project where a robotic clay aggregation method developed

      3.2 m long and 1.2 m high wall segment built using a six axis industrial
      robot mounted on a movable platform, and built with the robot re-localized
      three times. In this project we refined robot end effector, we
      experimented with feedback driven fabrication and trajectory planning for
      the robotic arm. The project was undertaken by Edurne Morales Zúñiga and
      myself with tutors David Jenny, Coralie Ming, Nicolas Feihl & Gonzalo
      Casas at Gramazio Kohler Research, ETH Zürich.

    abstract: >-
      Rapid Clay Formations (RCF) is an ongoing research project investigating
      robotic aggregation of soft clay elements. This thesis presents our research
      into RCF construction on an architectural scale.


      It outlines our development of a fabrication process suitable for the
      construction of tall and slender structures made out of clay. This
      fabrication process is evaluated through a series of prototypes and
      preparations for a three week building workshop.


      In our development we have evaluated and tested material behaviour and
      optimization, geometric sensing, robot trajectory planning and mobile
      robotic localization. These explorations are combined with design studies
      for large monolithic clay structures aimed at a rapid construction on site.

    abstract: >-
      Biological design is able to achieve remarkable functionality, resilience
      and adaptability without relying on centralized coordination or
      resource-intense materials. Agent-based construction seeks to emulate
      these advantages, but the two common approaches - swarm robotics and fully
      virtual agent simulations - are held back by limitations that are
      difficult to overcome in isolation. Here we demonstrate initial steps
      towards the application of biological design principles, particularly the
      so-called Bernard Machine. 3D printing is used to materialize the actions
      of virtual agents in a physical environment. Such an arena requires a
      shift from monolithic printing processes to interactive ones: assemblage
      printing. We demonstrate an alternative to conventional slicer-controlled
      printing that is discrete and to an extent nonsequential and which forms
      the foundation for assemblage printing. In its extension it allows for the
      exploration of a fully agent-based construction process.
