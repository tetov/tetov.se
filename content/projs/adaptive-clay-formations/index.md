Thesis project where a robotic clay aggregation method developed at MAS DFAB was
further explored and refined.
The project resulted in a 3.2 m long and 1.2 m high wall segment built using a
six axis industrial robot mounted on a movable platform, and built with the
robot re-localized three times.

In this project we refined robot end effector, we experimented with feedback
driven fabrication and trajectory planning for the robotic arm.
