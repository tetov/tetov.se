Meristem Wall is a prototype of a fully 3D printed building envelope made using
sand binder jetting and complemented with a custom CNC knitted fabric. The wall incorporates a
system of transient and controllable airflows modeled on the physiology of
termite mounds, allowing it to act as a climate modulator and provide a habitat
for urban wildlife.

The wall's geometry and the integrated airflow enables it to function as a
biological habitat, taking the concept of the green wall beyond a monocultural
garden. The wall is designed using an interdependent model that negotiates the
space and relationship between a wide range of functions including utilities,
aesthetic preferences, structural performance, and bioclimatic considerations.
This self-organizing simulation is capable of creating unique compositions of
space to fit a wide range of context and functional needs.
