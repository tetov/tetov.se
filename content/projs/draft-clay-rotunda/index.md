The Clay Rotunda is a free-standing earth-based cylindrical structure
constituting the outer, soundproof shell of the SE MusicLab, a high-fidelity
music auditorium built inside the newly refurbished Gurten Brewery in Bern. The
cylindrical structure combines clay, a sustainable zero-waste building material,
with computational design techniques. Featuring a diameter of almost 11 meters
the structure reaches a height of 5 meters with just 15 cm of unreinforced clay.
It was built in-situ by a mobile robotic system that aggregated over 30’000 soft
clay bricks over a period of 50 days.
