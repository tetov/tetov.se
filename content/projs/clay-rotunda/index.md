A circular undulating clay wall 5 m high with a 6 m radius built using a
method of robotic clay aggregation developed at MAS DFAB and in my thesis
project Adaptive Clay Formations.

The Clay Rotunda is a cylindrical structure made of clay that serves as the
outer shell of the SE MusicLab. Located inside the Gurtenbrauerei in Bern, this
high-fidelity music auditorium combines sustainable building materials with
computational design techniques.

With a diameter of nearly 11 meters and a height of 5 meters, the structure
features a thin wall width of only 15 cm, showcasing the strength and
versatility of unreinforced clay.

Using a mobile robotic system, over 30,000 soft clay bricks were aggregated
on-site over a span of 50 days to construct the Clay Rotunda.
