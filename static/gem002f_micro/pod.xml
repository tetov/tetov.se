<h1>Additional reading</h1>
<p>The word podcasting originates from the combination of iPod and
broadcasting, and poddies is a term used to define listeners of
podcasts. In 2004 the word podcast resulted in 24 hits according to
a Google search, however by 2007 this number rose up to 124
million.</p>
<p>Podcasts have the benefit of allowing anytime, anywhere
learning. Students can access the material when travelling,
commuting, or even at home. The recordings can be played at a
convenient for them time.</p>
<p>Podcasts are not interactive it is a one-way learning model
which can be supplemented by other teaching techniques and
reinforce the learning process. Early career students transition
from a more on-on-one approach in high school to university where
this style of teaching is not easily obtained. In those cases,
podcasts can be used as supplements to aid in more study material
outside of the given teaching times.</p>
<p>In this study, 53% of the students that used podcasts said it
helped their understanding of the topics. International students
that struggled with the language of instruction said it helped them
understand better and also enhanced their language skills in the
field.</p>
<p>Some students preferred text or transcripts as they simply do
not enjoy audio stimulation and find it less informative which
shows that they have a different learning technique.</p>
<p>Active listeners according to [2] are more likely to use this
tool and use it as a way to engage in the subject with their
preferred learning technique.</p>
<p>Instead of enhancing learning, these tools allow for a different
approach that might help students become more engaged in the topic
and supply more conversation topics between the teacher and
students.</p>
<p>Using podcasts as a cognitive tool might help students become
more engaged in a deeper learning context.</p>
<p>Supplying condensed summaries might deter some students from
attending lectures and create an assumption that listening to the
summaries is enough to obtain all the relevant information.</p>
